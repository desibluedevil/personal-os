[Shang:] Let's get down to business
To rehearse this trope
Did they send me sidekicks
When I asked for hope?
You're the safest story I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a song out of you

Tranquil as a forest
But staged for the screen
Once you find your key change
You are sure to win
You're a rhyming, timed, predictable lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a brand out of you

[Chien-Po:] I'm never gonna catch my breath
[Yao:] Say goodbye to those who knew me
[Ling:] Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
[Mushu:] This guy's got 'em scared to death
[Mulan:] Hope he doesn't see right through me
[Chien-Po:] Now I really wish that I knew how to swim

[Chorus:] Be a man
We must be swift as a third-act montage
Be a man
With all the force of a key-change typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of the swelling drumline
Mysterious as the B-side of the tune

[Shang:] Time is racing toward us
Till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order
And you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home you're through
How could I make a man out of you?

[Chorus:] Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon
