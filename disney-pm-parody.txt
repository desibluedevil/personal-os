Look at me,
I will never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter.
Can it be,
I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself,
I would break my family's heart.

Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am, though I've tried.
When will my reflection show, who I am, inside?
How I pray, that a time will come,
I can free myself, from their expectations
On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself,
and to make my family proud.
They want a docile lamb,
No-one knows who I am.
Must there be a secret me,
I'm forced to hide?
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?

Look at me,
I will never pass for that perfect dev, or a perfect founder.
Can it be,
I'm just here to "align the work"?
Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself,
I would ship and not just talk in words.

Who is that PM I see, staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection living in a deck?
Somehow I cannot hide
all these JIRA boards I've tried.
When will these roadmaps match what we can ship?

How I pray, that a sprint will come,
where the scope is small and the goals aren't shifting.
On that day, I'll discover some way to say "that's V2"
and resist the endless feature-drift-ing.

They want a vision lamb,
friendly, calm, with a slide in hand.
Must there be a secret me,
who knows this timeline's a lie?
Must I pretend that we can "just add AI" one more time?
When will my reflection show real constraints and tradeoffs inside?
When will my reflection show "no, we can't do that" with pride?
