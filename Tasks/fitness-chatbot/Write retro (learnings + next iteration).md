# Write retro (fitness chatbot prototype learnings)

## Context
Directly aligned to `GOALS.md`: build practical fluency in AI agents/tooling by shipping and documenting learnings.

## Next Actions
- [ ] Summarize what you built (stack, grounding approach, safety approach).
- [ ] Capture what worked / didn’t:
  - Retrieval quality (FAQ matching)
  - Refusal accuracy (false positives/negatives)
  - User satisfaction (clarity, usefulness)
- [ ] Review eval set outcomes:
  - Which questions failed? Why?
  - What’s the next fix: FAQ expansion, better routing, better clarifiers?
- [ ] Decide next iteration:
  - Expand FAQ sections
  - Add better personalization guardrails
  - Add simple onboarding questions (goal/equipment/time)

## Progress Log
- 2026-02-13: Task created from spec plan.
